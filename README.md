# QuickType Game

### Description

Speed typing game created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  
The game involves setting up a website where users can type a quote, and once they finish it a new one is generated.  
Currently, there is a wpm feature which tracks your wpm while you are typing, a leaderboard feature which stores your highest scores locally, as well as pause/restart features.

### API Quote Generation

The quotes are generated from the api linked here: 'http://api.quotable.io/random'.  
Credits to https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable for the quotes
